Decolonizing New Mexico centers a subject of astonishing complexity, including its people, places, moments in time and stories that reflect the beautiful and the tragic. 

It begins with a recognition that the present retain traumas born from the past, a spiritual, emotional and psychological wounding that radiates across the generations and has contemporary implications, including internalized wounds that are only beginning to be measured. 

It endeavors to center a process of decolonizing history, awakening consciousness by remembering. Decolonizing history is not easy and will require reckoning with hard truth. As Maori scholar, Linda Tuhiwai Smith, has cogently observed, “In order to decolonize our histories, we must revisit site by site.” Efforts to transform the impact of this trauma will actually require a concerted effort to contextualize and reimagine site-by-site, event-by-event and story-by-story, work that is reflected in both historic and recent activism. The approach is also based upon imaginative possibility. Novelist and Chicana scholar Emma Perez suggests the term “decolonial imaginary” as a way to overcome a colonial past, by literally recording presence and re-inscribing new possibilities.

Recovery, healing and transcendence is a process, but it begin with a critical, imaginative remembering. The goal is to awaken a practice of memory that does not complicate history, but invites us to make it.
