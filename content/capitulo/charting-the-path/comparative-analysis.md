### Overview

In an effort to contextualize this initiative, comparative research and analysis on methods and frameworks of various Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) projects provided insightful information. TRC models have been critical in resolving deeply rooted conflicts around the world, promoting the belief that confronting and reckoning with the past is necessary for successful transitions from conflict, resentment and tension to peace and connectedness.

While the first truth commission was formed in Uganda in 1974, others were initiated throughout Latin America in the 1970s and 1980s, taking the form of fact-finding, non-judicial committees or councils with the express purpose of uncovering the abuses committed by dictatorships and military juntas, and concomitantly, establishing a more inclusive and representative narrative of history for the country. Since the 1990s, even more countries in Latin America and Africa used this process, as have Australia, Canada and a few communities in the United States, followed with reconciliation after periods of inter-group conflict and political transition. 

The processes for these models have varied, though they typically involve both public and private activities designed to uncover and deepen the understanding of tragedies and/or human rights violations. TRC’s have continued to evolve, and particularly serve as an inspiration in the United States to redress historic legacies and to address the ongoing violence perpetrated against African Americans.

The Carnegie Council’s 2015 essay, “Examining the Potential for an American Truth and Reconciliation Commission” completed an analysis of several models for these commissions. The W.K. Kellogg Foundation also completed a TRC Comparison Booklet featuring 17 distinct initiatives, including those with national, federal-based focus like President Clinton’s Initiative on Race and the Japanese Internment initiative which resulted in an apology, reparations, and the preservation of 10 detention sites as national landmarks; private efforts such as that taken on by Brown University to investigate and prepare a report about the University’s historical relationship to slavery and the transatlantic slave trade, or that of the Episcopal Church to recognize its own participation and complicity in slavery. 

### Comparative Analysis - Truth and Reconciliation Commissions 

As noted previously, the Carnegie Council and the WKKF have produced thorough reports on many of TRC’s over the past 30 years. I have also summarized below some primary findings into  my own framework/outline.

#### South Africa Truth and Reconciliation Commission

Authorization:
: Under the guidance of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the TRC was established by the authority of the government of South African. The governing act was:  [Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act, No 34 of 1995](www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/1995-034.pdf). It operated, however, as an independent commission.

Where:
: Cape Town, South Africa 

Precipitating Events:
: In the aftermath of apartheid, the focus was on transforming race relations in a nationwide context and emphasizing restorative justice

When:
: While the effort to create a commission began in 1994, the TRC commenced on December 1, 1995. The commission officially ended its work in July 1998 after nearly three years of hearings and investigations into human rights violations committed during the apartheid era.

Structure:
: The commission implemented its mandate through three committees: the Amnesty Committee, Reparation and Rehabilitation (R&R) Committee and Human Rights Violations (HRV) Committee that ensured that both rehabilitation and reparations would be provided on an individual basis. It did not offer widespread amnesty to perpetrators, but instead enticed them to come forward and admit their guilt in exchange for amnesty case-by-case. 
: The TRC also created a [Register of Reconciliation](www.justice.gov.za/trc/ror/index.htm), which provided the public an opportunity to express their regret at failing to prevent human rights violations and to demonstrate their commitment to reconciliation. Live broadcasts of testimony of South Africans before the commissioners in a court-like setup were shown internationally. 

Challenges:
: The TRC favored an individualized approach that placed victims and perpetrators at the center of the process, rather than the apartheid system itself and its structures of governance. This framing may limit the applicability of the South African model to other settings since the focus upon 'victims' and 'perpetrators' individualized the reconciliation process  and allowed the system of apartheid, and those who worked within it, to remain in the shadows, hidden from scrutiny. Any TRC model that bypasses the role of institutions and structures of governance is heavily flawed regarding addressing structural racism.

#### Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada 

(the first TRC to in a society not undergoing fundamental government transition)

Authorization:
: Federal Government through an Order in Council, Schedule N of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement

Where:
: Canada (office in Winnipeg, Manitoba)

Precipitating Events:
: The abuses perpetrated by the church and government-run institutions against First Nations, Métis, and Inuit children in the Indian Residential School (IRS) system. Focus expanded to examine historic racist violence against Canada’s indigenous peoples.

When:
: 2009 - 2015

Structure:
: Built upon the “Statement of Reconciliation” dated January 7, 1998 and the principles developed by the Working Group on Truth and Reconciliation and of the Exploratory Dialogues (1998-1999), the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada was established in 2009. It spent six years traveling the country to hear the stories of more than 6,000 witnesses, and held seven national events that lasted four days each. 
: Commission Members: There were 3 commission members, appointmented from a pool of candidates nominated by former students, Aboriginal organizations, churches and government. The Assembly of First Nations (AFN) was consulted in making the final decisions and consideration was given to at least one of the three members being an Aboriginal person.
: There was also a ten-member Indian Residential Schools Survivor Committee that served as an advisory body to the TRC, as well as a Inuit Subcommission.

Outcomes:
: A final report released during a live webcast; creation of National Center for Truth and Reconciliation; calls to Action with 94 recommendations in education, health, child welfare, criminal justice

Challenges:
: The Canadian TRC treated the IRS system as a crime against humanity, and much like South Africa and apartheid, was not shy to label the system as one that perpetuated cultural genocide. At the same time, however, it repeated the same mistake as South Africa: the structures of governance that created the IRS system were not been critically examined. Additionally, the majority white, non-Aboriginal populace was largely disengaged from the process and further First Nations and Inuit communities were engaged on a case-by-case basis, compartmentalizing the process, as opposed to allowing the communities to lead the process themselves in a more culturally and historically nuanced way.

Lessons:
: The way in which the TRC emerged — from a legal process that required it, rather than emerging from a grassroots community effort — raised questions about the [political will](penguinrandomhouse.ca/haz) to continue wider reconciliation efforts after the mandate expired in June 2015.

#### Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission

Authorization:
: Private

Where:
: Greensboro, North Carolina 

Precipitating Event:
: On November 3, 1979, in Greensboro, local Ku Klux Klan and Nazi Party members ambushed a coalition of racial and economic justice protesters, killing and/or wounding more than 20 people.

Objective:
: Address the lasting effects of the massacre and the multiple exonerations by all-white juries, of the KKK and Nazi Party members involved, as well as policemen who had the knowledge to prevent the massacre.

Structure:
: 7 commission members including the executive director of the Fellowship of Reconciliation (the United States affiliate of the International Fellowship of Reconciliation); an associate professor of curriculum and instruction in the School of Education at N.C. A & T State University; a consultant and former city councilwoman, a counselor, certified nursing assistant and community activist; a retired corporate attorney; executive director of Greensboro's Faith Action International House; and a retired manager with Wrangler Corporation
: GTRCP (Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Project) coalesced and established mandate for a TRC; Andrus Family Fund and the International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ), and a National Advisory Committee provided financial, strategic and advisory support;   founding documents include the Guiding Principles and the Commission selection process. 
: Activities included engaging with the Greensboro community through a variety of educational, cultural and spiritual activities; collecting 67 Commission nominees from the community and assembling a Selection Panel representing 14 different sectors of the community; regular Commission meetings; community forums, public hearings.

Outcomes:
: 500 page final report issued and included recommendations for public memorials, apologies, government reforms, police reviews, increased wages for city employees, and revised school curriculum. The TRC successfully brought the perpetrators, the survivors, and the victims' families into public forums to recount the precipitating event, and at the same time allowed open discussion of the presence of systemic and societal racism. In 2015, City Council approved a historical marker memorializing the precipitating event.

Challenges:
: Despite the many positive aspects of the Greensboro process, ultimately many of its recommendations were not embraced or implemented. Although the TRC sought the support of the city of Greensboro, ultimately the predominantly white City Council rejected the TRC process and the commission's final report — and instead, only offered a statement of regret. 

Lessons:
: To institute long-term change, a TRC needs local government actors to commit to the changes necessary.

#### The Maine Wabanaki-State Child Welfare

Authorization:
: The state’s governor, in collaboration with five tribal chiefs

Where:
: Maine and Tribal state compact, located within its boundaries (Houlton Band of Maliseets, the Passamaquoddy at Sipayik and Motahkomikuk, the Aroostook Band of Micmacs, and the Penobscot Nation).

Precipitating Event:
: An era in the state's history that saw Native children sent into foster care at an alarmingly high rate, calling into question the state's adherence to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act. Specifically it was to investigate “whether or not the removal of Wabanaki children from their communities has continued to be disproportionate to non-Native children and to make recommendations that can promote individual, relational, systemic and cultural reconciliation.”

When:
: Began 2012 continuing for approximately 2½ years

Structure:
: Five commission members, including a Wampanoag man and a Sicangu Lakota adoptee from the Rosebud Reservation who was a child welfare consultant; the then Secretary of State, a faculty member at the University of Maine School of Social Work and an educational/organizational development consultant. 

Process:
: With funding from the Andrus Family Fund in 2008, the process began to create a TRC; in 2009, the Native child welfare workers invited the Maine Office of Child & Family Services (OCFS) to join them in writing the Declaration of Intent to create a TRC, subsequently signed in 2010 by the governor and 5 tribes; Mandate for TRC signed in 2012, which identified the Commission’s responsibilities, timelines and guidelines for its interactions with Tribal communities; In 2013, the Commission was seated during a day-long event held in Hermon, Maine. The previous day, a “Day of Reflection, Meditation and Prayer,” was held across the state, uniting diverse communities and organizations to pause in support of the TRC's work and purpose. The Commission's service was anticipated to run as long as 36 months; the TRC Commissioners, staff and truth and reconciliation consultants gathered for intensive planning sessions, named staff, and opened its office in 2013. 

Testimony: 
: After months of preparation, the Commission took testimony and met with individuals, families and child welfare workers. To build relationships, they planned extended stays in each tribal community. In these communities, groups formed to provide support for those affected by the truth-telling process.

Outcomes:
: The TRC engaged both Native and non-Native populations, being both very responsive to the needs of tribal communities and navigating non-Native networks within one of the more sparsely populated and geographically isolated states of the east coast. Specifically, the outcomes: 
: 
  - Report by Commission (2015) recommending a range of actions for addressing the inequities it found. (There has not been sufficient time to assess the full impact)

  - In addition to recommendations specific to the operation of the Maine child welfare system, the Commission advocated that the people of Maine:

    - “Respect tribal sovereignty and commit to resolve and uphold federal, state and tribal jurisdictions and protocols at both state and local levels, and 

    - “Honor Wabanaki choices to support healing as the tribes see fit and celebrate the cultural resurgence of the tribes within the Wabanaki confederacy so that both individuals and communities may be strengthened

Challenges:
: The outcomes of the TRC lacks widespread understanding in the state amongst the non-Native population, and the grassroots nature of the MWTRC, like Greensboro, has resulted in funding challenges. Nevertheless, the MWTRC may provide one the most innovative model for others in the country, to replicate and adapt accordingly.

Lessons: 
: Learning lessons from the TRCs in South Africa, Canada, and Greensboro, the MWTRC has managed to pioneer a very different model. Like South Africa, the MWTRC drafted its mandate and formed a commission, in this case to inquire into the forced removal of Native children and those affected during the process, while also (unlike South Africa) placing the state and its child welfare system under examination. The truth-telling and healing mechanisms of the MWTRC are very similar to those seen in the Canadian TRC process, such as sharing circles and private testimony. The MWTRC also sought to change child welfare practices fundamentally and systemic reconciliation between the child welfare practices of the state and those of the tribes. 
: Learning from Greensboro, the MWTRC obtained the signatures of the five tribal governments and the state of Maine, and, like Greensboro, also formed an organization (i.e. Maine Wabanaki REACH) to help fulfill the specific and wider goals of the TRC within and beyond its mandate.

#### Confederate Memorials Removal Initiative - New Orleans, LA

Authorization:
: New Orleans City Council, as outlined in City Code Section 146-611, which governs the procedure for removal of public property structures that are deemed to be a nuisance.

Where:
: New Orleans, Louisiana

When:
: 2015 - 2017

Precipitating Event:
: 2018 Tricentennial planning and 2015 Charleston/Mother Bethel murders

Structure/Process:
: 60-day period of facilitated discussions and public meetings, in conjunction with the City’s Human Relations Commission, the Historic District Landmarks Commission, the Mayor’s Welcome Table initiative, the Vieux Carre Commission, the City Attorney’s Office, the superintendent of the New Orleans Police Department, the director of the Property Management Department and Chief Administrative Officer Andy Kopplin

Objective:
: To explore, particularly for those that did not have a voice at the time of installation, whether the Confederate monuments, built to reinforce the false valor of a war fought over slavery, ever really belonged in New Orleans, particularly as the city looked to its 2018 tricentennial.

Outcome:
: New Orleans City Council voted 6-1 to remove four monuments to the Confederacy from prominent places in the city including statues of Gens. Robert E. Lee, P.G.T. Beauregard and Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy. The removal was supported by a local landmarks commission, the Human Relations Commission and Clergy for a United City, "a citywide interfaith group of nearly 100 pastors of leaders. [POSTSCRIPT: With the election of a new mayor in 2017, a new commission was established to determine new placement of the removed memorials which has caused dissent, as at least two are recommended to be placed in an area easily visible to the public, though not on public land].

### Recommendations & Strategies

As the Western Apache say of their homelands in Arizona, wisdom sits in places and New Mexico is certainly no exception. But one cannot grow wise by simply looking at the surface of the buildings or in neighborhoods. I believe that wisdom can only be achieved by seeing past the layers, which in essence make it deeply and profoundly contested and connected. It means thinking about what connects one site to the next as part of a deeply complex and intricate network. Sometimes this is visible and can be mapped, but for instance, it can also be found in the flow of the acequia, the profundity of language, music and traditions that linger long after a note has been played, the dust rising ever so slightly from an ancient dance. All of these hold the memory of places, and its people and spirit. But these spaces are also sacred because here is where people have lived for generations, burying their dead, nurturing their young, as well as their minds and their hearts. 

In this way, navigating through historic trauma toward transformation will require a roadmap. No matter the direction, it should be expected that making a change of this nature will inevitably cause discord in the community. Making space for peaceful protest is an imperative, however, for civic discourse has always depended upon it, as a necessity for transformation. In what follows are some high level recommendations and strategies. Building upon years of advocacy, whether it has come in the form of a film or through direct protest, this work has already begun. The transformative work in the Española and Santa Fe Fiestas are testament to those decades long and more recent efforts thanks to the courage and commitment to open, honest and moving conversations. But, even there, it is important to recognize that change is a process much more work is required. Beyond these two events, there are many other issues at hand, each requiring perhaps a concerted strategy. In developing some thoughts and ideas as recommendations, we first must recognize the fundamental importance of truth telling and acknowledge historical realities, both of which have frame over time this place we now call New Mexico. We must also identify the values that are core to the communities subject to this report, perhaps utilizing existing structures to do so. Finally, we should be open to continual iteration and prototyping, as this work remains one of process.

#### Core Values

Core values, like wisdom and memory, are deeply embedded in the world views and structures of traditional land-based communities like those of New Mexico —both Native American and Indo-Hispano — and retaining these values over time, they have governed life, creating balance. Because of the devastation of historic trauma, however, knowledge and wisdom has been lost for some. In this way then, decolonization is about recovery. As I write, with Santa Fe moving through its recent decision to abolish the Entrada. For some of us who have been working on this, recognize that this is only the beginning. What must follow transformation is reconciliation and healing. In this work,  it will be critical to develop a process engaging the community to identify core values, to identify the source of those values and to define to what extent these values serve to guide lives. We expect that this individual, heart-centered work will support collective healing.

#### Theoretical Models and Frameworks

There are certain theoretical models that I have turned to over the years in my work to decolonize and they remain relevant to this process of transformation, if not reconciliation and healing. The work of Linda Tuhiwai Smith for instance, is definitive in this way. In Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples, Tuhiwai Smith identifies 25 Indigenous projects that she notes have “derived from the imperatives inside the struggles of the 1970s that placed at the center the survival of peoples, cultures and languages and the struggle to become self-determining, the need to take back control of destinies. These projects include: Claiming, Testimonies. Storytelling, Celebrating Survival, Remembering, Indigenizing, Intervening, Revitalizing, Connecting, Reading, Writing, Representing, Gendering,. Envisioning, Reframing, Restoring, Returning, Democratizing, Networking, Naming, Protecting, Creating, Negotiating, Discovering, and Sharing. Each of these are ideas for change that move toward transformation.

The models identified by Smith are universal, particularly as they are drawn from histories and experiences of the past and across many cultures. There are other models embedded in local wisdom and cultural traditions that are also equally worth examining. I think of the Cochiti Storyteller, a seated clay figurine of a grandmother or grandfather, blossoming with children, with an open mouth, reflecting the active role of telling story. I have always thought of this figure, not only as the embodiment of tradition and creativity, but revealing a profound wisdom and philosophy — a muse relating the collective memory of a community, serving not only to tell story, but revealing that power that narrative holds in bringing community together. I am also reminded of what in northern New Mexico is called la resolana. This place is literally the south side of a building or a plaza, shielded from the wind and bathed in the rays of the sun.  What makes this place dynamic is the fact that for generations it has gathered men and women who carefully articulate observations about their contemporary world, relating the memory and wisdom of those that came before them, and creating an open dialogue for what may come.  In both of these examples that awaken possibility, the methodology is storytelling and dialogue is pivotal.

#### Recommendations

In the spirit of imagining reconciliation, I propose the following ideas for consideration:  

- Apology: Moving forward means sometimes acknowledging a wrong, which depends on an apology and the inverse power of rising up and saying, “I forgive you.” History, as well as basic human relations, teaches us that we have to acknowledge harm to move through it. We cannot reverse what happened, but it can be acknowledged with regret. Indeed, transformation requires it. 

  The fact that the Archbishop John Wester has taken the lead in another major reconciliation efforts is notable. First, on September 12, 2017, the Archdiocese of Santa Fe released the names of nearly 100 priests and religious leaders who were accused or later found guilty of sexually abusing children. With the release of these names, the Archbishop noted, “We must practice openness and transparency whenever possible, as this is essential for rebuilding trust and healing wounds.”  The Archbishop also has declared the intention of providing an apology for the historic injustices inflicted by the Church upon Native American peoples of the region. This act of humility is incredibly powerful. 

  In yet another notable act of humility and courage, in 2015, Anastacio Trujillo, who had himself portrayed DeVargas in 2008, requested and was granted the opportunity to read a prayer from Elizabeth Christine for the Honoring Our Pueblo Existence (HOPE) group at Santa Clara Pueblo, as well as a quote from Pope Francis. On July 9, 2015, addressing the Native peoples in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, he offered both the acknowledgment and apology in saying:

  > I say this to you with regret: many grave sins were committed against the native people of America in the name of God. My predecessors acknowledged this, and I too wish to say it. Like St. John Paul II, I ask that the church kneel before God and implore forgiveness for the past and present sins of her sons and daughters. I would also say, and here I wish to be quite clear, like St. John Paul II, I humbly ask forgiveness, not only for the offenses of the Church herself, but also for crimes committed against the Native peoples during the so-called conquest of America.

  The reading from Mr. Trujillo revealed his own coming to consciousness and sensitivity to these matters, but even deeper, an understanding of how powerful an apology can be. To have had the insight to invoke this strategy was important.  

  While these examples demonstrate the impact that this simple act can have, there is more work to be done in this realm of ‘the apology.’

- Countering or Cura-ting Context and Counterpoints for Monuments in New Mexico: While communities across the nation have begun to respond with various strategies, including removal of monuments and other memorials, others have called for providing more context and counterpoint to them. What is done will depend upon the will of the community and perhaps the specific monument or memorial. As a first step, it will be important to identify and map existing monuments in New Mexico. This work was in part begun by the City of Santa Fe, but remains incomplete.[^1] Heidi Brandow, an artists who is participating as a fellow at the Santa Fe Art Institute (SFAI) as part of the SFAI Story Maps initiative, is currently partnered with the City of Santa Fe's Parks Department, working on social engagement project that examines memorials throughout the city. Her project is concerned with creating an inventory of current monuments and further divides monuments based on demographic information, such as: gender represented and ethnicity represented. In this, visual representations such as maps are also being made to reflect the data collected and her goal is to include, as she notes, “a proposal that re-envisions the addition of memorials that impart more inclusive and historically accurate representations of the unique and complicated history of Santa Fe.”

	Beyond the inventorying of these monuments across the state, one strategy would be to follow the work in New Orleans and begin a process for removal of those monuments that are deemed challenging in a modern era. Making these determinations, may be the work of a commission (see below).
 
	Another strategy would be to focus curating the monuments. This could be accomplished as a community engagement effort, in combination with media artists to raise consciousness and engender a creative reimagining and critical remembering. By providing an intersection for arts, technology and history, the aim would be to explore the possible transformation of public spaces into forums for inclusion and multiple voices, versus the current singular, static narratives that have reproduced negative social relations. Toward developing a process for transformation, the work will help us tests assumptions and identify new paths of public engagement. 

  Finally, following inventory and assessment, it could be a combination of both removal and contextualization.

- Community Engagement Toward Raising Consciousness and Fostering Community 

  - Resolanas: Indo-Hispano communities throughout northern New Mexico could share information and address internal and often long-standing tensions through Resolanas. This is a potential model for open and transparent dialogue.

  - Gathering Stories: While there were many points in Santa Fe’s history punctuated by violence and conflict over the past 300 years, there have also been times of positive convergence and unity reflected in cross cultural marriages, inter-kin networks (comadrazgo and compadrazgo) and friendships.  Gathering and disseminating these historic and contemporary testimonies could be profound.

  - Tracing the Degrees of Connection: Frigyes Karinthy’s 1929 short story, Chains, first espoused the concept that only six degrees of separation exist between all people; though in spite of the current divisions in our community, I believe there are even fewer separations given of our size. The goal of this project would be to chart that connectivity. 

  - Accentuating Ancestry: In spite of more than century of accentuating false notions that Native American and Hispano communities are homogenous,  they actually share some common ancestors. Revealing this genetic connectivity through a community-wide family tree project would function to create new openings for understanding the past. The work of genealogist and historian José Antonio Esquibel is notable in this regard.  

  - Envisioning A Future: Invite the public to participate in writing a letter from the future. Envisioning themselves as members of the Fiesta Council in 2021, five years from now, writers can reveal how reconciliation led to a Fiesta that brought the community together.

- Establish a Truth, Racial Healing and Transformation Commission: In response to the contention around the Fiesta, in 2016 I wrote a letter to the editor of the Santa Fe New Mexican, recommending the establishment of a “Santa Fe Fiesta Reconciliation Commission.” Since then the All Pueblo Council of Governors passed a conceptual framework (December 2017) delineating a five-point plan for formal negotiations regarding the Santa Fe Fiesta, including the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This plan, including the commission, was reaffirmed in a proclamation by the All Pueblo Council of Governors on July 19, 2018.   

  As noted in the Introduction, when McCune originally engaged me to begin to deepen the work of healing and transformation, I submitted a proposal to establish what I called then, the “Santa Fe Truth, Racial Healing and Transformation Initiative.” This initiative included the development of what I noted would be a “formalized local, apolitical, nongovernmental entity designed to operate independently and flexibly to identify constructive avenues to facilitate civic trust.” 

  As the proposal evolved, however, recognizing that this initiative necessarily deserved to be broader than simply Santa Fe, I focused on foundational research, both local and comparative, noting especially the imperative of ‘making the case’ to first assess the viability of a commission, and then to frame the process and action steps. Another step that began, but  is Collaborative planning also began, but will need to deepen and include community engagement. 

  With the completion of this research and analysis, including a careful assessment of how these initiatives and commissions have operated in other communities, I have concluded (again) that it would be useful to establish a commission. I recommend that it be broader than Santa Fe and that it emphasize the process, moving first toward transformation, then reconciliation; and if it can be had, healing. Toward this end, I suggest  the following steps be undertaken: 

  1. Determine Focus and Breadth
    
      Focus and scope of this initiative should be defined that encompases a broad geographic area, though the initial focus could begin more locally.

  2. Develop a Collaborative Planning & Public Engagement Process

      While this work already has begun in limited ways, the focus has been narrowly targeted on Santa Fe, there is also a tremendous amount of work that has begun in Espanola. To expand, Iit will be important to explore many more possible collaborations with organizations, institutions and individuals through research and in-person meetings in order to strengthen the capacity and resources. These could include media, education, Nonprofits, Religious  and political partners. 

  3.	Develop Commission Structure and Objective
While some commissions have been solely located within a government structure and others have been defined through a groundswell in the community. I recommend, a combination that is grounded in both grassroots but actively includes working with government officials in state and local municipalities. This hybrid model can ensure that communities drive the effort and that desired outcomes, to the extent needed, can be implemented through official channels. Further, a mandate must be developed and embraced to the reasoning and broad goals for the commission.

  4.	Nomination Process
Once the structure is defined, it will be important to establish a democratic and community-wide nomination process to identify Commission members, including meeting with key stakeholders in advance, drafting public communications and other messaging, offering press interviews, analyzing nominations, and recommending members.
