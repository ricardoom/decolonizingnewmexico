### About this Project

Dr. Estevan Rael-Gálvez launched this project in 2017 with the support of the McCune Foundation which requested him to deepen the work he began after his consulting firm completed Culture Connects Santa Fe, the City of Santa Fe’s first cultural plan. The goal of the project was to understand and address the various manifestations of historic trauma that have continued to divide the community of Santa Fe. Initially, the Santa Fe Truth, Racial Healing and Transformation Initiative defined the work with the targeted goal of establishing a commission. While it was always recognized that the transformation from something as profoundly complex as colonialism would be an extensive process, early stakeholder engagement revealed the need to undertake further research to underpin the long-term effort. The project also expanded beyond Santa Fe.

Decolonizing New Mexico is the culmination of community engagement and a depth of research effort. The project leveraged Dr. Rael-Gálvez’s work as a colonial studies scholar, trained particularly as an anthropologist and historian, but also his decade’s long community advocacy working with and in community. This website is meant to enter gather historical context and ideas toward the development of a process, centering truth and transformation in New Mexico. It is neither comprehensive, nor complete and as more information is collected, more will be added to this website.
