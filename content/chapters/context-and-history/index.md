New Mexico’s story is one of astonishing complexity. It is set within a magnificent and sovereign landscape that is both ancient and modern. Its people are the heirs to unique and richly woven histories, traditions and a depth of wisdom and memories, all manifest in the physical and social landscape, tangible and intangible.
 
Like the breath left behind by those that came before, memory and wisdom are like precious seeds that have continued to retain their germinative power. Particularly imperative in the times in which we are living, awakening this capacity will require both a critical and a creative re-member-ing, passing what happened here back through heart and mind, in order to make this place and its people whole. Moving beyond the surface, this effort will invite us to listen vigilantly to what we hear and to look carefully at what we see; and to pull back the complex layers that make this story contested — people, places, moments in time and the stories that reveal the delicacy and strength of the human condition. The following reflections then, are tellings glimpses of New Mexico.
