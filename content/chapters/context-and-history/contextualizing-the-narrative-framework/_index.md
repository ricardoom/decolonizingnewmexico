If “historic trauma” is the cumulative spiritual, emotional and psychological distress and wounding that is passed down from generation to generation, the question is how, when, where it is reflected in the present? This section of the report responds to these questions, providing context to the multiple issues that frame the social and cultural environment that is largely defined by historic trauma in New Mexico. Part of this context is about how colonialism, patriarchy and all levels of supremacy are manifest, in both tangible and intangible ways. 

Toward this end, working toward providing an understanding to these issues, in what follows, this section is organized around the questions of how, when and where are these manifestations continue to exist — in the vocabulary, the symbols, the stories, the events, the sites and the narrative frameworks. While much of what follows is in summary and by no means is it comprehensive, I hope to continue to broaden and deepen this work over the years. Each of these areas overlap, however, they are presented herein as independent, simply as a way of organizing. Within each of these sections, defined by multiple issues, I will also work to document the responses, if and where they have arisen.   

**Section One: Underlying vocabulary, symbols and narrative frameworks**

**Section Two: Manifestations in Sites, Events**

**Section Three: Narrative Frameworks**
