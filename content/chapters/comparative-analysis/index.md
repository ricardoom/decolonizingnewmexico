## Overview
In an effort to contextualize this initiative, comparative research and analysis on methods and frameworks of various Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) projects provided insightful information. TRC models have been critical in resolving deeply rooted conflicts around the world, promoting the belief that confronting and reckoning with the past is necessary for successful transitions from conflict, resentment and tension to peace and connectedness.

While the first truth commission was formed in Uganda in 1974, others were initiated throughout Latin America in the 1970s and 1980s, taking the form of fact-finding, non-judicial committees or councils with the express purpose of uncovering the abuses committed by dictatorships and military juntas, and concomitantly, establishing a more inclusive and representative narrative of history for the country. Since the 1990s, even more countries in Latin America and Africa used this process, as have Australia, Canada and a few communities in the United States, followed with reconciliation after periods of inter-group conflict and political transition. 

The processes for these models have varied, though they typically involve both public and private activities designed to uncover and deepen the understanding of tragedies and/or human rights violations. TRC’s have continued to evolve, and particularly serve as an inspiration in the United States to redress historic legacies and to address the ongoing violence perpetrated against African Americans. 
The Carnegie Council’s 2015 essay, “Examining the Potential for an American Truth and Reconciliation Commission” completed an analysis of several models for these commissions. The W.K. Kellogg Foundation also completed a TRC Comparison Booklet featuring 17 distinct initiatives, including those with national, federal-based focus like President Clinton’s Initiative on Race and the Japanese Internment initiative which resulted in an apology, reparations, and the preservation of 10 detention sites as national landmarks; private efforts such as that taken on by Brown University to investigate and prepare a report about the University’s historical relationship to slavery and the transatlantic slave trade, or that of the Episcopal Church to recognize its own participation and complicity in slavery.
