This manuscript works to set the foundation for the work that is required to create transformation.<!--more--> Some of the questions before us are: how do we acknowledge the traumas of the past and yet still foster transformation in both present and future; how can we (re)imagine spaces, events and stories that are inclusive, that celebrate the complexity of its residents; how do take the harms and create possibility in healing? 

At noted, at the heart of this initiative, the goal of this particular document, Decolonizing New Mexico, is to make the case for why it is imperative to initiate this process. Toward this end, this monograph has been developed to begin to document elements that constitute historic trauma in New Mexico and to explore the possibilities for transformation and healing. 

Living history is learning from it. This is what it means to raise consciousness, part and parcel of the capacity of humanity. Toward this goal of accentuating the depth and breadth of what it means to be human, underlying this report is the objective of supporting catalytic transformation based on a balanced commemoration and critical approach. This work is based on three key principles that have and continue to define my work, an approach that is centered upon designing and implementing experiences that: 

- _Nurture and raise **consciousness:**_ This effort should stir curiosity and is not simply about getting people to think about the world around them, including about the imperative of different points of view, but it is also about cultivating new forms of knowledge.

- _Build and foster **community:**_ The goal, I hope, encourages us to think deeply about how history and the sites that serve as its touchstones and as ‘community based assets’ as well as the events could be leveraged to fortify a community’s sense of its identity. More than just theorizing equity and participation, it is about working with the community to create relevant and meaningful experiences.

- _Illuminate and inspire **creativity:**_ My upbringing and professional training has grounded me in interdisciplinary approaches, and my professional experience has taught me that engaging creatives in the work reveals unexpected outcomes, deepening the interpretive work in community. This is as much about art and ideas as it is about innovation.
